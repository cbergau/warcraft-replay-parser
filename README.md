Motivation

Library to parse Warcraft III Replay files.

**NOTE**

    THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL YET!
    SOME FEATURES HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED YET, AND SOME REFACTORINGS HAVE TO BE DONE ASWELL.
    THERE ARE ALSO SOME CODE PARTS THAT NEED TO BE REWRITTEN, BECAUSE I WAS TRYING THINGS OUT.
